# Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct that is formed by starting with the number 1 and then adding the two numbers above it together to form the next number. The first few rows of Pascal's Triangle look like this:

```
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
```

You can see that the number `2` is the sum of `1` and `1` above it. Similarly, the number `3` is the sum of `1` and `2` above it.
