# Sandpiles

<!-- write readme file for 0-sandpiles.c -->

## Description

This project is about sandpiles. A sandpile is a grid of numbers that represents a pile of sand. When a sandpile has more than 3 grains of sand in a cell, the cell will topple and distribute the grains to its neighbors. This project contains a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles.

## Files

- `0-sandpiles.c`: C function that computes the sum of two sandpiles.
- `0-main.c`: Main file to test the function.
- `sandpiles.h`: Header file.
